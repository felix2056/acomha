                                of their experience of mental health.

                                You can also help support us by downloading Give as you Live. This means that whenever
                                you shop online, they will donate a percentage of the purchase to us at no cost to you.

                                Another option is to hold your own event to raise money for us, for example a Tea and
                                Talk with your friends or colleagues. There are lots of ideas of other ways to raise
                                money for us as a fundraiser.

                                A very simple way you can help support us is just by sharing information from us that
                                you find useful with friends and family, to help spread awareness of mental health
